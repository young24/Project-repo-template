For the Data folder, all files will be uploaded as LFS objects. If you don't want some data being uploaded to GitHub, you can save them in the Working folder or save them on a server and put a link in the data folder.

If you need any help, or have questions, please post an issue on [here](https://github.com/young24/Perfect-Lab-System/issues). I'd like to help you.
